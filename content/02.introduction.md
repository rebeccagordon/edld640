Poverty impacts 17% (approximately 22,742) of families with children under age six in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020). This number is rising each year and has increased 2% since 2019 (Shrider et al., 2021). While experiencing childhood poverty itself is a distinct stressor, there are additional cumulative environmental stressors associated with lower income that are often overlooked (Evans & English, 2002). For example, children who experience poverty are more likely to be exposed to substandard housing, neighborhood violence, toxins, ambient pollutants, alcohol and substance use, and crime throughout the lifespan (Evans & Kim, 2007; Theall et al., 2012). Children exposed to an accumulation of multiple income-related stressors are at greater risk of poor socioemotional and health outcomes than those exposed to a singular stressor (Evans & English, 2002).
Prolonged exposure to income-related stressors, especially in early life, causes toxic stress to accumulate in the body, impeding healthy cognitive development and disrupting biological processes (Evans & Kim, 2012). Rates of chronic disease, early mortality, and lower life expectancy are higher for individuals living in poverty (Healthy People, 2020). Individuals from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds experience disproportionate morbidity and account for more than half of healthcare utilization in the United States (Evans & Kim, 2007). Therefore, it is likely that understanding the mechanisms by which early exposure to poverty leads to later health outcomes could prevent disease and mortality for more than half of the population (Boyce & Hertzman, 2018). There are clear and well-established links between early exposure to poverty in childhood and health problems in adolescence however, the mechanism for this relationship is unclear (Evans & Kim, 2007, 2012). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26876607/222283456-f37507b0-5741-454c-8e2d-3d3bea8fea34.png)
