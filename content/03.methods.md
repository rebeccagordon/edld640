# Methods 

Data were obtained from three waves of the second cohort of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II). NSCAW II used a two-stage stratified sampling design, which first selected nine sampling strata consisting of the eight states with the largest child welfare caseloads and the remainder of the United States. NSCAW II study sampled cases from Child Protective Services investigations of families that were closed between February 2008 and April 2009 nationwide. Data collection includes three waves: 4 months, 18 months and 36 months after the close of an investigation. The final sample of children was representative of the national population of children birth to 17 years of age in families being investigated for allegations of maltreatment. Our analysis followed youth birth to 14 years of age at baseline to account for children ageing out. Response rates for waves 2 and 3 ranged from 84 % to 94 %.
